Facebook API Marketing Notes

### Facebook API Business Use and reports: 

- **Ad Reporting**: This enables you to see basic metrics for your ads such as impressions, clicks and conversions such as purchases and app installs
- **Order Level Reporting**: You can use these reports to understand which   ads led to a response at a specific point in a conversion funnel
- **Lift**: With Facebook Lift Measurement you can see the true impact your ads have on real people for any business objective, including direct response.
- **Audience Network**: With Audience Network, you can monetize your app by showing Facebook ads in it.
  - Facebook Audience Network is an off-Facebook, in-app advertising network for mobile apps. Advertisers can serve up their ads to customers who are using mobile sites and apps other than Facebook,  extending their reach beyond the platform while still getting to use Facebookâ€™s exceptionally powerful ad system (see [here](<https://adespresso.com/blog/facebook-audience-network/>))
  - FAN audience placement ad options:
    - Native, banner, and interstitial
    - In-stream videos
    - Rewarded videos
